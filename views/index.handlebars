                <hr/>
                <p>I am a self taught developer specialized in building applications using primarily PHP or NodeJS for server side logic. I specialize in many different technologies spanning the entire development cycle and because of this, I am capable of taking a concept and bringing it into a deployable product. To do this I frequently collaborate with multiple departments in order to bring a project to fruition.</p>

            <p class="text-dark font bold">Custom Docusign Solution</p>
            <p>This project was quite exciting. My boss came to me and requested our own custom document signing platform. At that point, we were still using <a href="https://docusign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DocuSign</a>, and while it is relatively cheap considering all it provides, we needed a more efficiently streamlined experience for our users.</p>

            <p>This is the first time I'd had to work with manipulating PDF's programmatically and in order to begin, I had to take a step back and break the project down. First I had to break it down ask myself what needed to happen. I came up with this essentially:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>A user needed to create a digital signature</span></li>
                <li><span>That signature needed to be added to a document in a specified location.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <p>After some thinking and consulting my coworkers I decided to somehow convert the user's signature into an image, and then place that image on a PDF. I found a library on Github called <a href="https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SignaturePad JS</a> that did some of the heavy lifting. All I had to do was configure it for our system and do some minor styling.</p>

            <p>Once that was done, I spent some time looking into how to take that image, and insert it into a PDF. I finally stumbled onto FPDI, a library for parsing and manipulating pdfs. With this addon I was able to complete the final step. So now whenever we have a new document needing our user's signature, all I have to do is plug some X & Y coordinates into my code and the rest is taken care of.</p>

            <p class="text-dark font bold">Quick Note Chrome Extension</p>
            <p>I was curious about Chrome extensions one day and had a small piece of functionality that I thought would be useful, so I built a small rudimentary extension for a quick and easy method of storing some text you need for later. I have some additions and refinements I plan on making, but it is full functional.</p>

            <p>This was a small piece of functionality I made for a coworker to that allowed him to increase his productivity. He was familiar with the terminal and wanted to use it more, so he requested a CLI. The overall process was not too difficult, but the outcome was quite helpful. Feel free to use or check it out <a href="https://github.com/neecholaus/csv-to-json-converter" target="_blank">here</a>.
