<h4>My name is</h4>
<h1>Nick Neuman,</h1>
<h3>and I'm not a designer.</h3>

<p>I specialize in many different technologies spanning the entire development cycle and because of this, I am capable of taking a concept and bringing it into a deployable product.</p>
<p>If you have a project that needs an insightful developer, feel free to send me an email describing what you're looking for. I enjoys new challenges and building things and am more than happy to take a look.</p>
